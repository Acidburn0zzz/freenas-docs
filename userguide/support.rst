.. index:: IRC
.. _IRC:

IRC
---

To ask a question in real time, you can use the *#freenas* channel on
IRC
`Freenode <http://freenode.net/>`_.
Depending on the time of day and your time zone, %brand% developers or
other users may be available to provide assistance. If no one answers
right away, remain on the channel, as other users tend to read the
channel history to answer questions as time permits.

Typically, an IRC `client
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients>`_
is used to access the *#freenas* IRC channel. Alternately, use
`webchat <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=freenas>`_
from a web browser.

To get the most out of the IRC channel, keep these points in mind:

* Do not ask "can anyone help me?". Just ask the question. If someone
  knows the answer, they will try to help.

* Do not ask a question and then leave. Users who know the answer
  cannot help you if you disappear.

* Do not take it personally if no one answers or demand that someone
  answers your question. Maybe no one who knows the answer is
  available, maybe your question is really difficult, or maybe it is a
  question that has already been answered many times in the other
  support resources. Try asking again in a few hours or research the
  other resources to see if you have missed anything.

* Do not post error messages in the channel as the IRC software will
  probably kick you out. Instead, use a pasting service such as
  `pastebin <http://www.pastebin.com/>`_
  and paste the resulting URL into the IRC discussion.


.. index:: Mailing Lists
.. _Mailing Lists:

Mailing Lists
-------------
