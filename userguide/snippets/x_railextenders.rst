X Series Rail Extenders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The stock X series rails can be installed in racks up to 30 inches
deep.

Racks from 31 to 36 inches deep require installation of the included
rail extenders. For these deeper racks, install cage nuts on the
outside rear of the rack.
**The tabs on the cage nuts must be horizontal**.
Using the included bolts, install the rail extender inside the rear of
the rack. Repeat the process for the second extender, which is a
mirror image of the first. Proceed with rail kit installation.
