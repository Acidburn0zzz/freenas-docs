Install Drive Trays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array. Each drive tray has
a status LED which is blue when active or amber if a fault has
occurred.

Recommended drive tray installation order: first, SSD drives for SLOG
(if present), followed by SSD drives for L2ARC (if present), followed
by hard drives. Install the first drive tray in the top left drive
bay. Install the next drive tray to the right of the first. Install
remaining drive trays to the right across the row. After a row is
filled with drives, move down to the next row and start again with the
left bay. This order simplifies support and is strongly recommended.

Press the blue button to open the latch. Carefully slide the tray into
a drive bay until the left side of the latch touches the metal front
edge of the chassis, then gently swing the latch closed until it
clicks into place.
