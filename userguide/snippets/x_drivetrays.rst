Install Drive Trays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array. Each drive tray has
a status LED which is blue when active or amber if a fault has
occurred.

A tray must be placed in each drive bay to maintain proper airflow for
cooling. If fewer than twelve drives are connected, empty "air baffle"
trays must be placed in the empty bays.

A standard drive tray installation order is recommended:

* SSD drives for SLOG, if present

* SSD drives for L2ARC

* Hard drives

* Air baffle filler trays

Install the first drive tray in the top left drive bay. Install the
next drive tray to the right of the first. Install remaining drive
trays to the right across the row. After a row is filled with drives,
move down to the next row and start again with the left bay. This
standard order simplifies support and is strongly recommended.

The example shown here is an X series with a SLOG SSD, an L2ARC SSD,
eight hard drives, and two empty air baffle trays.

Press the blue button to open the latch. Carefully slide the tray into
a drive bay until the left side of the latch touches the metal front
edge of the chassis, then gently swing the latch closed until it
clicks into place.
