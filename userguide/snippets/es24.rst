Become Familiar With the ES24
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ES24 has front panel buttons for power and alarm mute, and
indicators for power, locate ID, and fault. The fault indicator is on
during the initial power-on self-test (POST) or when the %brand%
software has issued an
`alert
<https://support.ixsystems.com/truenasguide/tn_options.html#alert>`__.

.. index:: Rail Kit Assembly

Rail Kit Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove Cabinet Rails from Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Extend the cabinet rail until it stops. To remove the cabinet rail,
press the white release tab to the right while pulling the cabinet
rail.

.. _cabinet_rail_removal:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_cabinet_rail1.png


Mount Cabinet Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cabinet rails are mounted on both sides of the system. Align the
cabinet rail keyhole with the post on the side of the chassis and pull
the rail until the post is wedged in the smaller hole.


.. _cabinet_rail2:
.. image:: images/tn_es24_cabinet_rail2.png


Align the rail holes with the screw holes and secure the rail with
three of the supplied cabinet screws included with the rail kit.
Repeat this process on the other side.

.. _rail_screws:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_rail_screws.png
   :width: 15%


Mount the Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Place the rail in the rack with the front end toward the front of the
rack, aligning the pins with the mounting holes in the front rack.
Push the pins in the holes until the latch clicks. Secure rail in
place with the front rail screw included in the rail kit. Repeat this
process for the second front rail.

Install two square cage nuts on the front end of the rack, one
directly above the top rail pin and the other in the third rack hole
above it. Repeat this process on the other front rail. The cage nuts
will later support the screws used to secure the enclosure to the
rack.

For the rear end of the rail, align the pins with the mounting holes
on the rear rack. Pull the white latch toward the rear until the pins
click in place. Repeat this process for the second rear rail.


.. _rack_rail_install:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_rack_rail_install.png
   :width: 60%


Mount the Unit in the Rack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Caution: Two people are required to safely lift the chassis for rack
installation or removal.** Do not install drives until after the
chassis has been installed in the rack, and remove all drives before
removing the chassis from the rack.

Pull the front rack rail forward until it stops. Align the cabinet
rail with the inside of the front rack rail and slide the cabinet rail
forward until it is fully seated inside the rack rail. Repeat the
process for the second rail.


.. _rack_rail_to_cabinet_rail:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_cabinet_meets_rack.png
   :width: 60%


When both cabinet rails are secured inside of the rack rails gently
push the chassis until it stops halfway in. Slide the blue release
tabs on both cabinet rails toward the front of the system while
pushing the unit in until it is flush with the front of the rack.


.. _mount_system_in_rack:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_mount_system.png
   :width: 60%


Anchor the unit in the rack on both sides with the 6-32 screws
included in the rail kit.


.. _secure_system_in_rack:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_secure_unit.png
   :width: 50%


Install Drive Trays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array. Each drive tray has
a status LED which is blue when active or amber if a fault has
occurred.

Press the silver button to open the latch. Carefully slide the tray
into a drive bay until the right side of the latch touches the metal
front edge of the chassis, then gently swing the latch closed until it
clicks into place.


.. _drive_installation:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_drive_tray1.png
   :width: 60%


Connect Power Cords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Do not plug the power cords into a power outlet yet.** Connect a
power cord to the back of one power supply, pressing it into the
plastic clamp and pressing on the tab to lock it in place. Repeat the
process for the second power supply and cord.

.. _power_cord_connection:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_power_cord.png
  :width: 25%


Connect SAS Cables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shut down and power off the ES24. Remove the ES24 power cables from
the power outlets.

Plug the ES24 power cords into power outlets.
**Wait two minutes for the drives to start.**

Plug one end of the SAS cable into the T1 connector on the ES24
expansion module 1. Plug the other end into the SAS 1 connector on
the X10's node 1. See cable #1 in
:numref:`Figure %s <es24_sasconnect1>`.

If the X10 has a second node for HA (High Availability), plug one end
of the second SAS cable into the T1 connector of the ES24's expansion
module 2. Plug the other end into the SAS 1 connector on the X10's
node 2. See cable #2 in
#ifdef comment
:numref:`Figure %s <es24_sasconnect1>`.

.. _es24_sasconnect1:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_sasconnect1.png

   SAS Cable Connection for One ES24
#endif comment


A second ES24 can also be connected to the X10. After connecting the
first ES24 as shown above, plug one end of an SAS cable into the
T1 connector on the second ES24's expansion module 1. Plug the other
end into the SAS 2 connector on the X10's node 1. See cable #3 in
#ifdef comment
:numref:`Figure %s <es24_sasconnect2>`.
#endif comment

If the X10 has a second node for HA (High Availability), plug one end
of an SAS cable into the T1 connector of the second ES24's expansion
module 2. Plug the other end into the X10's node 2, SAS 2 connector.
See cable #4 in
#ifdef comment
:numref:`Figure %s <es24_sasconnect2>`.


.. _es24_sasconnect2:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_sasconnect2.png

   SAS Cable Connection for Two ES24s
#endif comment

After all SAS cables have been connected, plug the X10 power cords
into power outlets.
