Become Familiar With the System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ES24 has front panel indicators for power, locate ID, and
fault. The fault indicator is on during the initial power-on self-test
(POST) or when the %brand% software has issued an
`alert
<https://support.ixsystems.com/truenasguide/tn_options.html#alert>`__.

Rail Kit Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Mount the Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install a spring on the silver posts in the side of each rail.

.. _es24_spring:
.. figure:: images/ab.png
   :width: 50%

   Installing Rail Springs


Open the clamp latches on the ends of each rail. Place the rail in the
rack with the front end toward the front of the rack, aligning the
pins on both ends of the rail with the mounting holes in the rack.
Swing the clamp latch closed to hold the rail in place. Use two of the
supplied screws to secure the back end of the rail in place. Repeat
the process for the second rail.

   Rail Clamp Latch


Mount the Unit in the Rack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Caution: Two people are required to safely lift the chassis for rack
installation or removal.** Do not install drives until after the
chassis has been installed in the rack, and remove all drives before
removing the chassis from the rack.

Snap the black bezel mounting ears onto the metal ES24 chassis ears.
Carefully place the ES24 chassis onto the rails mounted in the rack.
Push the ES24 chassis in until the ears are flush with the front of
the rack.  Use two of the supplied screws to secure each ear to the
rack.

Install Drive Trays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array. Each drive tray has
a status LED which is blue when active or amber if a fault has
occurred.

Press the blue button to open the latch. Carefully slide the tray into
a drive bay until the left side of the latch touches the metal front
edge of the chassis, then gently swing the latch closed until it
clicks into place.

   Installing Drive Trays


Connect Power Cords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Do not plug the power cords into a power outlet yet.** Connect a
power cord to the back of one power supply, pressing it into the
plastic clamp and pressing on the tab to lock it in place. Repeat the
process for the second power supply and cord.

   \newpage


Connect SAS Cables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shut down and power off the X10. Remove the X10 power cables from the
power outlets.

Plug the ES24 power cords into power outlets.
**Wait two minutes for the drives to start.**

Plug one end of the SAS cable into the T1 connector on the ES24
expander module 1. Plug the other end into the SAS 1 connector on
the X10's node 1. See cable #1 in
:numref:`Figure %s <es24_sasconnect1>`.

If the X10 has a second node for HA (High Availability), plug one end
of the second SAS cable into the T1 connector of the ES24's expander
module 2. Plug the other end into the SAS 1 connector on the X10's
node 2. See cable #2 in
:numref:`Figure %s <es24_sasconnect1>`.

   SAS Cable Connection for One ES24


.. raw:: latex

   \newpage


A second ES24 can also be connected to the X10. After connecting the
first ES24 as shown above, plug one end of an SAS cable into the
T1 connector on the second ES24's expander module 1. Plug the other
end into the SAS 2 connector on the X10's node 1. See cable #3 in
:numref:`Figure %s <es24_sasconnect2>`.

If the X10 has a second node for HA (High Availability), plug one end
of an SAS cable into the T1 connector of the second ES24's expander
module 2. Plug the other end into the X10's node 2, SAS 2 connector.
See cable #4 in
:numref:`Figure %s <es24_sasconnect2>`.

   SAS Cable Connection for Two ES24s


After all SAS cables have been connected, plug the X10 power cords
into power outlets.


Install Bezel (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included bezel is not required for operation. If desired, install
the bezel by aligning it with the pins on the bezel ears and pressing
it into place.
