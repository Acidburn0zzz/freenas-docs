Rail Kit Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Separate Cabinet Rails from Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each rack rail includes an inner cabinet rail that must be removed.
Extend the cabinet rail as shown below until the white release tab is
exposed. Slide the white release tab to the right to release the
cabinet rail. Remove the cabinet rail from the rack rail. Repeat the
process for the second rail.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_rail_separate.png
   :width: 85%



Mount Cabinet Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cabinet rails are mounted on each side of the system. Align the
cabinet rail keyholes with the posts on the side of the chassis. Slide
the rail toward the rear of the system until the metal tab clicks and
secures the rail in place. Repeat this process on the other side.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_cabinetrails.png
   :width: 85%


Mount Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ES60 occupies 4U of rack space. The rails are mounted in the
center 2U of that space.

Cage nuts for racks with square and round holes are included. Install
four cage nuts inside the rack, two where the rails attach to
the front of the rack, and two at the rear. Align each cage nut with
the others, both front to back and left to right. The cage nuts
provide an attachment point inside the rack for the rail screws.

The rail ends are stamped *Front* and *Rear*. Place one rail in the
rack with the *Front* stamp at the front facing outward. The *Rear*
stamp goes at the back of the rack. Align the pins on both rail
ends with the mounting holes in the rack. Make sure the cage nuts line
up with the rail holes. Push the pins into the rack holes until they
lock in place. Use the provided screws to secure the rails to the cage
nuts.

Mount Unit in the Rack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Caution: Two people are required to safely lift the chassis for rack
installation or removal.** Do not install drives until after the
chassis has been installed in the rack, and remove all drives before
removing the chassis from the rack.

Lift the ES60 with attached cabinet rails and align the cabinet rails
with the inside front of the rack rails.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_cabinet_mount.png
   :width: 60%


Carefully slide the ES60 forward into the rack rails until the unit
stops (#1). Locate the blue tabs on the inside of the cabinet rails.
Slide the tabs toward the front of the ES60 and hold them in place
(#2). Push the chassis into the rack until the ears are flush with the
front of the rack (#3). The thumbscrews on the ears are used to secure
the unit in the rack after drive trays have been installed (#4).

Drive Tray Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**Do not install the drives until the chassis has been installed in
the rack.**


Remove Top Cover
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Slide the unit out on the rails. Unscrew the cover screws to unlock
the top cover. Slide the top cover forward, then lift it off.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_remove_cover.png
   :width: 75%


Install Drive Trays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array.

A standard drive tray installation order simplifies support and is
strongly recommended: install SSD drives for SLOG first, if present.
Follow this with SSD drives for L2ARC, if present, then hard drives or
SSD drives for data storage.

Install the first drive tray in the front left drive bay. Install the
next drive tray to the right of the first. Install remaining drive
trays to the right across the row. After a row is filled with drives,
move back to the next row and start again with the left bay. A label
on the front left of the lid shows the preferred order of drives.

Slide the tray button left to open the latch. Carefully lower the
drive tray into a drive bay until the latch begins to move into place.
Push the latch down until it locks into place.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_drivetray_install.png
   :width: 100%


**For proper airflow and cooling, the entire first row of drive trays
must be installed. The top cover must also be in place when the unit
is on.**

ES60 Cable Management Arm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included cable management arm (CMA) is not required for operation.
If desired, the CMA can be used to help organize the ES60 power and
data cables.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_parts.png
   :width: 85%


The tabs along the side of the flex housing can be unclipped from the
top, the bottom, or removed entirely.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_tabs.png
   :width: 20%


Install the Cable Management Arm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Locate the two posts on the left rear side of the ES60. The ES60 can be
pulled slightly out of the rack to better locate the posts. Align the
holes on the CMA chassis bracket with the posts on the chassis. Slide
the cable management arm forward and pull the lever on the latch upward
to lock the bracket into place.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_clip.png
   :width: 85%


Locate the end of the flex housing with exposed pins. Unclip and open
the two tabs closest to the end, allowing the flex housing to compress
enough to fit into the bracket holes. Press the flex housing firmly
into the bracket until the pins seat in the holes.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_chassis_flex.png
   :width: 85%


Remove the two screws already attached to the side of the CMA rail
bracket. Align the screw holes with the holes in the rear of the left
cabinet rail and attach the bracket to the rail with the screws.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_bracket_rail.png
   :width: 40%


Locate the end of the flex housing with exposed holes. Unclip and open
the two tabs closest to the end, allowing the flex housing to expand
enough to fit over the bracket pins. Press the flex housing firmly
into the bracket until the holes seat on the pins.

Completed Cable Management Arm assembly:


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_complete.png
   :width: 80%


Power and data cables are routed through the flex housing. The tabs
can be opened or removed to allow access or space for cable ends.
Leave some slack in the cables at both ends to allow for movement of
the arm and chassis.


Connect Power Cords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Do not plug the power cords into a power outlet yet.** Connect a
power cord to the back of one power supply, pressing it into the
plastic clamp and pressing on the tab to lock it in place. Repeat the
process for the second power supply and cord. Plug both power cords
into a outlets. This turns on the ES60. **Wait two minutes for the
drives to start.**


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_powerclip.png
   :width: 25%


**Service and management ports are not used during normal operation.
Do not connect anything to them.**

If the %brand% system is already in operation, the expansion shelf
can be powered on at any time.


Connect SAS Cables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The %brand% system can remain on while the expansion shelf is
connected.

The ES60 is compatible with several %brand% systems. Typical SAS cable
connections for one or two ES60 expansion shelves to %brand% High
Availability (HA) systems are shown here. When a %brand% unit with
only a single storage controller is used, only cables #1 and #3 are
connected.


**X-Series**

The X20 supports a single ES60 expansion shelf. The ES60 must be
connected to the first SAS ports (cables #1 and #2). An additional
ES12 or ES24 expansion shelf can be connected to the second SAS ports
with cables #3 and #4.

   \newpage


**M-Series**

The %brand% M-Series supports multiple ES60 expansion shelves, which
can be combined with other %brand% expansion shelves.


**M40**

* Connect cable #1 to the first ES60, expansion controller 1 SAS 1
  port.

* Connect cable #2 to the first ES60, expansion controller 2 SAS 1
  port.

If a second ES60 is present (not supported on the X-series):

* Connect cable #3 to the second ES60, expansion controller 1 SAS 1
  port.

* Connect cable #4 to the second ES60, expansion controller 2 SAS 1
  port.

Install Bezel (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included bezel is not required for operation.

Line up the screw holes on the back of the bezel with the screw holes
on the ears of the ES60. Install one upper screw from the back side of
the left ES60 ear, then install a lower screw from the back of the
right ES60 ear. Install the remaining two screws following the same
diagonal pattern.
