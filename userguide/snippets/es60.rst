Become Familiar With the ES60
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ES60 has indicators on the front panel for power, fault, and
locate ID. The fault indicator is on during the initial power-on
self-test (POST) or when the %brand% software has issued an
`alert
<https://support.ixsystems.com/truenasguide/tn_options.html#alert>`__.

Rail Kit Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Separate Cabinet Rails from Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each rack rail includes an inner cabinet rail that must be removed.
Extend the cabinet rail until the white release tab is exposed.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_rail_separate.png


Press the white release tab to the right while pulling the cabinet
rail to remove it. Repeat this process for the second rail.


Mount Cabinet Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cabinet rails are mounted on each side of the system. Align the
cabinet rail keyholes with the posts on the side of the chassis. Slide
the rail toward the rear of the system until the metal tab clicks and
secures the rail in place. Repeat this process on the other side.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_cabinetrails.png


Mount Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install 4 cage nuts in the rack, one for each bracket. The lock screw
for the bracket is already installed in the cage nut. Place the rail
in the rack with the front end toward the front of the rack and rear
toward the back of the rack, aligning the pins on both ends of the
rail with the mounting holes in the rack. Push the pins into the rack
holes until they lock in place.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_rackrails.png


Mount Unit in the Rack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Caution: Two people are required to safely lift the chassis for rack
installation or removal.** Do not install drives until after the
chassis has been installed in the rack, and remove all drives before
removing the chassis from the rack.

Slide the front rack rail forward to meet the rear of the cabinet
rails. Align the cabinet rail with the inside of the front rack rail
and slide the cabinet rail forward until it is fully seated inside the
rack rail. Repeat the process for the second rail.

.. figure: <sj-storage: IMG_6428 or IMG_6463>


When both cabinet rails are secured inside the rack rails, carefully
slide the chassis until the ears are flush with the front of the rack.
Turn both blue screws on the ears of the chassis to the right to
secure the unit in the rack.

.. figure: <sj-storage: IMG_6080_copy_working_copy.psd>


Drive Tray Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. note:: Do not install the drives until the chassis has been
   installed in the rack.


Remove Top Cover
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Turn the blue screws counterclockwise to unlock the top cover. Slide
the top cover toward the front of the system, then lift to remove it.

.. figure: <sj-storage: IMG_6226.png>


Install Drive Trays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array. Each drive tray has
a status LED which is blue when active and amber when a fault occurs.

Press the blue button to open the drive tray latch and gently remove
the tray from the drive bay.

.. Add TEXT about attaching a drive to the tray?

To insert a drive, release the handle with the tab on the front of the
drive chassis, push it into a drive bay until the drive handle begins
to move into place, then push it the rest of the way until the handle
locks into place.


.. figure:


.. note:: Drives are not numbered and can be installed in any
   available bay.


.. figure: <sj-storage: IMG_6190drive_install_machup_es60.xcf>


Connect Power Cords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Do not plug the power cords into a power outlet yet.** Connect a
power cord to the back of one power supply, pressing it into the
plastic clamp and pressing on the tab to lock it in place. Repeat the
process for the second power supply and cord. This turns on the ES60.

.. figure: <sj-storage: es60_powerclip_nov17.png>


.. note::  Service and management ports are not used during normal
   operation and should not be connected.


If setting up a %brand% Storage Array for the first time, wait two
minutes after turning on the Expansion Shelf before powering on the
%brand% Array. If a %brand% Array is already in operation, the
Expansion Shelf may be powered on at any time.


Connect SAS Cables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shut down and power off the ES60.

.. <more text required, see Wiring Guide>

.. figure: <sj-storage: IMG_8962gimp.xcf - remove mark number circles>


Install Bezel (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included bezel is not required for operation. If desired, install
the bezel by lining up the two holes on each side of the bezel with
the back of the ears on the ES60. Attach a screw on one side, then the
next diagonally on the opposite side. Follow this pattern for the
remaining screws.


.. figure:

ES60 Cable Managment Arm (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included cable management arm (CBA) is not required for operation.
If desired, the CBA is used to organize the ES60 power cords and other
cables.


Install the Cable Management Arm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On the rear side of the ES60, locate the two pin posts on the left
side. Align the holes on the bracket of the cable management arm with
the posts on the chassis. Slide the cable management arm forward and
pull the lever on the latch upwards to lock the cable management arm
into place.


.. figure:


Remove the two screws already attached to the side of the cable
management arm. Align with the screw holes for this end and reattach
the screws. Both pieces are now attached to the chassis.


.. figure:


.. note:: The tabs can be unlocked from above or below. If needed,
   both tabs can be unlocked.


.. figure:

Using the Cable Management Arm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Route and secure the power cords and other cables, including SAS
cables, onto the cable-management arm:

   Install Rack Mounting Rails
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Remove the rail set and screws from the rail kit box. Use only the
   screws labeled for use in the type of rack provided. Have two
   people support each rail while mounting it to the rack using the
   top and bottom screw holes. The rail surface should remain inside
   of the rack boundaries. These images show proper rail installation
   with the front and rear of the rails mounted.

   Install the ES60 Expansion Shelf in the Rack
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   **Caution: Two people are required to safely lift the chassis for
   rack installation or removal.** Do not install drives until after
   the chassis has been installed in the rack, and remove all drives
   before removing the chassis from the rack.

   Align the chassis rails with the installed rack rails and gently
   slide the chassis into the rack until it stops. Press in the slide
   locks, then slide the chassis in until the face of the ES60 is
   flush with the rack.


   .. figure:


   With the face of the ES60 flush with the rack, attach it by
   pressing and turning the built-in thumbscrews on the front panel.
