Become Familiar With the ES60
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ES60 has indicators on the front panel for power, fault, and locate
ID. The fault indicator is on during the initial power-on self-test
(POST) or when the %brand% software has issued an
`alert
<https://support.ixsystems.com/truenasguide/tn_options.html#alert>`__.

.. note:: Do not install the drives until the chassis has been
   installed in the rack.



Install Rack Mounting Rails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove the rail set and screws from the rail kit box. Use only the
screws labeled for use in the type of rack provided. Have two people
support each rail while mounting it to the rack using the top and
bottom screw holes. The rail surface should remain inside of the rack
boundaries. These images show proper rail installation with the front
and rear of the rails mounted.

Install the ES60 Expansion Shelf in the Rack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Caution: Two people are required to safely lift the chassis for rack
installation or removal.** Do not install drives until after the
chassis has been installed in the rack, and remove all drives before
removing the chassis from the rack.

Align the chassis rails with the installed rack rails and gently slide
the chassis into the rack until it stops. Press in the slide locks,
then slide the chassis in until the face of the ES60 is flush with the
rack.


.. image:


With the face of the ES60 flush with the rack, attach it by pressing and
turning the built-in thumbscrews on the front panel.

Install the Drives in the Expansion Shelf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To insert a drive, release the handle with the tab on the front of the
drive chassis, push it into a drive bay until the drive handle begins
to move into place, then push it the rest of the way until the handle
locks into place.


.. image:


.. note:: Drives are not numbered and can be installed in any
   available bay.



Plug in the SAS Cables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to the Wiring Guide.

.. REF Wiring Guide IMAGE



Plug in the Power Cables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plug both power cables into the power outlets and secure the cables
with the plastic cable locks. This turns on the Expansion Shelf.


.. note::  Service and management ports are not used during normal
   operation and should not be connected.


.. image:

If setting up a %brand% Storage Array for the first time, wait
two minutes after turning on the Expansion Shelf before powering on the
%brand% Array. If a %brand% Array is already in operation, the Expansion
Shelf may be powered on at any time.



Install the Bezel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The back of the bezel has two screws on the left and right side. Align
the two holes on each side with the back of the ears on the ES60. Attach
a screw on one side, then the next diagonally on the opposite side.
Follow this procedure for each remaining screw.

.. image:



Install the Cable Management Arm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the rear of the ES60 JBOD, locate the two pin posts on the left
side of the expansion shelf. Align the holes on the bracket of the
cable management arm with the posts on the chassis. Slide the cable
management arm forward and pull the lever on the latch upwards to lock
the cable management arm into place.

.. image:


Remove the two screws already attached to this side of the cable
management arm. Align with the screw holes for this end and reattach the
screws. Both pieces are now attached to the chassis.

.. image:


.. note:: The tabs can be unlocked from above or below. If needed, both
   tabs can be unlocked.

Lock in the Power Cable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This step eliminates the risk of accidentally disconnecting the power
cable.


.. image:


Insert the power cable into the plastic clamp and press down on the
tab to lock the power cable in place.


.. image:


Secure the Power Cords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Route and secure the power cords and other cables, including SAS cables,
onto the cable-management arm. This is shown in the next image:
