  .. caution:: The rails have a specific front end, shown on the left
     above. They must be attached to the rack with the front end of
     the rails toward the front of the rack.


* Up to 12 populated drive trays

The X10 can contain two nodes in a side-by-side configuration. The
ports on each node, from left to right, are:

* two GbE network ports; underneath these ports are two USB 2.0 ports

* Out of Band (OOB) management ports

* two HDmini SAS3 ports

* a PCIe mezzanine expansion port

* a 3.5mm serial port


Underneath the ports are two redundant power supplies.

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array:

Each drive tray has a status LED which is blue when active or amber
if a fault has occurred.

Rail Kit Assembly
-----------------


Mount the Outer Rails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the clamp latches on the ends of each rail.
:numref:`Figure %s <x10_rail_clamp>`
shows a clamp in the open position:

.. _x10_rail_clamp:

.. figure:: images/tn_x10_rail_clamp.png

   Rail Clamp


Place the rail in the rack, aligning the pins on both ends of the rail
with the mounting holes in the rack. Rotate the clamp latches toward
the rack, locking the rail in place. Repeat for the second rail on the
other side of the rack.


Mount the Unit in the Rack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. caution:: Two people are required to safely install the %brand%
   array in a rack or cabinet, or to remove it.

Carefully place the inner rails on the sides of the X10 chassis onto
the outer rails mounted in the rack. With the rails aligned, push the
X10 chassis in until it is flush with the front of the rack. Secure
the chassis in place with the supplied screws.

   Mounting the X10 in a Rack


Installing Drive Trays
----------------------

Install the drive trays into the X10 unit.


Installing Expansion Shelves
----------------------------

If expansion shelves are to be used with the X10, please see the
installation instructions supplied with the shelves.


Cabling
-------

Connect the network cables and Out of Band (OOB) management port
before attempting to power on and configure the %brand% X10 array for
the the first time. If the system was preconfigured by iXsystems, the
Out of Band management interface has already been configured.
Otherwise, it must be configured before use. Please see the Out of
Band Management section of the %brand% User Guide at
`<http://support.iXsystems.com>`__.

If it is not possible to configure the Out of Band management before
the initial configuration, connect the provided 3.5mm serial cable to
the 3.5mm jack on the back of the unit. Connect the USB end of the
cable to a laptop or desktop computer running serial terminal
software. Set the terminal software to *38400 baud*, *8 data bits*,
*no stop bits*, *no parity*, and *no flow control*.

When connecting through the Out of Band management port, an IP address
is obtained from DHCP.

Username: **sysadmin**

Password: **superuser**

After booting, the IP address of the %brand% web GUI is shown on the
system console, visible through the Out of Band management system.


Connecting Power Cords
----------------------

If any %brand% expansion shelves are connected to the X10 array, power
them on first, then wait at least two minutes before connecting power
cables to the X10 array.

.. note:: Do not plug the power cords into a power outlet yet.

Plug a power cord into the back of one power supply, pressing it into
the plastic clamp and pressing on the tab to lock it in place. See
:numref:`Figure %s <x10_power>`:

.. _x10_power:
.. figure:: images/tn_x10_power_clip.png

   X10 Power Cord Connection


Repeat the process for the second power supply and cord. After both
cords have been connected to the X10, they can be connected to power
outlets.

The %brand% X10 Array is configured to automatically power on when
connected to a power outlet. This design ensures that the X10
automatically comes back on when power is restored after a power
failure.


Optional: Install the Faceplate
-------------------------------

The %brand% X10 comes with faceplate installation ears on the left and
right side of the system. Make sure these ears are present, then align
the faceplate with the pins and press it into place.


Perform %brand% Initial Software Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------

If the %brand% X10 was preconfigured by iXsystems, enter the chosen IP
address into a web browser on a computer on the same network. If the
X10 was not preconfigured, please contact a %brand% Support
Representative.
