  .. caution:: The rails have a specific front end, shown on the left
     above. They must be attached to the rack with the front end of
     the rails toward the front of the rack.

  .. caution:: Unused drive bays must be populated with drive tray
     blanks to maintain proper airflow for cooling.

The X10 contains one or two nodes in a side-by-side configuration. The
connectors and features on each node are:

1,2: Gigabit Ethernet connectors

3: USB memory stick (reserved for %brand% use)

4: USB 2.0 connector

5: 3.5mm serial port

6: Out-of-Band (OOB) Management Ethernet connector

7,8: HDmini SAS3 connectors

9: PCIe mezzanine expansion port

10: System Management port (reserved for %brand% use; a gray cable
connects this port to a USB port above the OOB management port)

11: MAC address label

12, 13: Redundant power supplies


Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array:

   Drive Tray


Each drive tray has a status LED which is blue when active or amber
if a fault has occurred.


.. index:: Rail Kit Assembly

Rail Kit Assembly
-----------------


Mount the Outer Rails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the clamp latches on the ends of each rail.
:numref:`Figure %s <x10_rail_clamp>`
shows a clamp in the open position:

.. _x10_rail_clamp:

.. figure:: images/tn_x10_rail_clamp.png

   Rail Clamp


Place the rail in the rack, aligning the pins on both ends of the rail
with the mounting holes in the rack. Rotate the clamp latches toward
the rack, locking the rail in place. Repeat for the second rail on the
other side of the rack.


Mount the Unit in the Rack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. caution:: Two people are required to safely install the %brand%
   array in a rack or cabinet, or to remove it.

Carefully place the inner rails on the sides of the X10 chassis onto
the outer rails mounted in the rack. With the rails aligned, push the
X10 chassis in until it is flush with the front of the rack. Secure
the chassis in place with the supplied screws.


Install Drive Trays
-------------------

Insert each tray into a drive bay until it stops, then switch the
latch closed until it locks.


Install Expansion Shelves
-------------------------

If expansion shelves are to be used with the X10, please see the
installation instructions supplied with the shelves.


Connect Network Cables
----------------------

.. note:: Network cables vary by configuration and are not included.
   Please contact your iXsystems Account Manager with any questions.

.. note:: A shielded Ethernet cable must be used to connect the
   Out-of-Band (OOB) management port.


Connect the network cables and Out-of-Band (OOB) management port
before attempting to power on and configure the %brand% X10 array for
the the first time.

If the system was preconfigured by iXsystems, the
Out-of-Band management interface has already been configured.
Otherwise, it must be configured before use. Please see the
Out-of-Band Management section of the %brand% User Guide at
`<http://support.iXsystems.com>`__.

If it is not possible to configure Out-of-Band management before the
initial configuration, connect the provided black USB to 3.5mm serial
cable to the 3.5mm jack on the back of the X10. Connect the USB end
of the cable to a laptop or desktop computer running serial terminal
software. Set the terminal software to *38400 baud*, *8 data bits*,
*no stop bits*, *no parity*, and *no flow control*.

When connecting through the Out-of-Band management port, an IP address
is obtained from DHCP.

Username: **sysadmin**

Password: **superuser**

After booting, the IP address of the %brand% web GUI is shown on the
system console, visible through the Out-of-Band management system.

Connect Power Cords
-------------------

If any %brand% expansion shelves are connected to the X10 array, power
them on first, then wait at least two minutes before connecting power
cables to the X10 array.

.. note:: Do not plug the power cords into a power outlet yet.

Plug a power cord into the back of one power supply, pressing it into
the plastic clamp and pressing on the tab to lock it in place. See
:numref:`Figure %s <x10_power>`:

.. _x10_power:
.. figure:: images/tn_x10_power_clip.png

   X10 Power Cord Connection


Repeat the process for the second power supply and cord. After both
cords have been connected to the X10, they can be connected to power
outlets.

The %brand% X10 Array is configured to automatically power on when
connected to a power outlet. This design ensures that the X10 comes
back on when power is restored after a power failure.


Install Bezel (Optional)
------------------------

The included bezel is not required for operation. If desired, install
the bezel by verifying that bezel connection ears are present on the
left and right sides of the system. Align the bezel with the pins on
the ears and press it into place.


Configure Out-of-Band (OOB) Management
--------------------------------------

The %brand% X10 Out-of-Band management IP address is set by default to
*192.168.100.100* with a subnet mask of *255.255.255.0*.


Perform %brand% Initial Software Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------

If the %brand% X10 was preconfigured by iXsystems, enter the chosen IP
address into a web browser on a computer on the same network.

The local DHCP server can be configured to provide a fixed address to
the X10. Use the MAC address on the sticker on the back of the X10 to
configure the IP address the DHCP server assigns, or check the DHCP
server logs to determine which IP address was assigned to that MAC
address.
