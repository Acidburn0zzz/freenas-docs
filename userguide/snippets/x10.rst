Rail Kit Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Mount the Outer Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open the clamp latches on the ends of each rail. Place the rail in
the rack with the front end toward the front of the rack, aligning
the pins on both ends of the rail with the mounting holes in the rack.
Swing the clamp latch closed to hold the rail in place. Use the
supplied screws to secure the back end of the rail in place.

   Rail Clamp Latch


Repeat the process for the second rail.


Mount the Unit in the Rack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. caution:: Two people are required to safely lift the chassis for
   rack installation or removal. Do not install drives until after the
   chassis has been installed in the rack, and remove all drives
   before removing the chassis from the rack.


Carefully place the inner rails on the sides of the X10 chassis onto
the outer rails mounted in the rack. With the rails aligned, push the
X10 chassis in until it is flush with the front of the rack. Secure
the X10 in place at the front with the supplied screws.


Install Drive Trays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array:


.. _x10_tray:

   Installing Drive Trays


Connecting Expansion Shelves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to the installation instructions included with expansion
shelves for details on connecting them to the X10.


Connect Network Cables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Network cables vary by configuration and are not included.
   Please contact your iXsystems Account Manager with any questions.

.. warning:: The Out-of-Band (OOB) management port must be connected
   with a shielded Ethernet cable.


Connect network cables to the Ethernet ports and Out-of-Band (OOB)
management port before attempting to power on and configure the
%brand% X10 for the the first time.


Connect Power Cords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If any %brand% expansion shelves are connected to the X10 array, power
them on first, then wait at least two minutes before connecting power
cables to the X10 array.

.. note:: Do not plug the power cords into a power outlet yet.

Plug a power cord into the back of one power supply, pressing it into
the plastic clamp and pressing on the tab to lock it in place. See
:numref:`Figure %s <x10_power>`:

   X10 Power Cord Connection


Repeat the process for the second power supply and cord. After both
cords have been connected to the X10, they can be connected to power
outlets.

The %brand% X10 Array is configured to automatically power on when
connected to a power outlet. This design ensures that the X10 comes
back on when power is restored after a power failure.


Install Bezel (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included bezel is not required for operation. If desired, install
the bezel by verifying that bezel connection ears are present on the
left and right sides of the system. Align the bezel with the pins on
the ears and press it into place.

Discover Out-of-Band Management IP Address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a variety of ways to determine the IP address that is being
used by the %brand% X10 Out-of-Band management interface.


Preset
^^^^^^

If the system was preconfigured by iXsystems, the Out-of-Band
management interfaces have already been configured with the IP
addresses requested by the user.

Otherwise, the Out-of-Band management IP addresses are set by default
to static addresses:

Node 1: *192.168.100.100*, subnet mask *255.255.255.0*

Node 2 (if present): *192.168.100.101*, subnet mask *255.255.255.0*


DHCP
^^^^

If the Out-of-Band management IP address has been configured to be
assigned by DHCP, the IP address assigned by the DHCP server can be
determined by checking the local DHCP server logs for the MAC
addresses on the back panel of each X10 node, #11 on
:numref:`Figure %s <x10_back>`.

The local DHCP server can also be configured to provide a fixed IP
address for the X10 Out-of-Band management by using the MAC address.


.. _X10_Serial_Cable:

Serial Cable
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Out-of-Band management IP address can be identified or changed by
temporarily connecting the black USB to 3.5mm serial cable to the
Out-of-Band serial port, #5 on
:numref:`Figure %s <x10_back>`.

.. warning:: Do not leave the black USB to serial cable connected to
   the X10. Do not use the serial port for any purpose except checking
   the initial X10 Out-of-Band management IP address or setting that
   address to be obtained by a different method. After checking or
   changing these settings, disconnect the black USB to serial cable.


Connect the USB end of the black cable to a laptop or desktop
computer running serial terminal software.


.. _X10_Out-of-Band Serial Terminal Communication Settings:

Out-of-Band Serial Terminal Communication Settings
..................................................

**Serial Port Device Names**

The name of the serial port varies with operating systems. These are
some typical examples:

  * on Windows: :samp:`COM{4}`

  * on macOS: :samp:`/dev/tty.usbserial{xynnn}`

  * on FreeBSD: :samp:`/dev/cuaU{0}`

  * on Linux: :samp:`/dev/ttyUSB{0}`


**Serial Port Communication Parameters**

Set the serial terminal program to use the appopriate port with these
parameters:

.. code-block:: none

   38400 baud
   8 data bits
   no stop bits
   no parity
   no flow control


Log in to the serial console with:

Username: **sysadmin**

Password: **superuser**

The current Out-of-Band management IP address is displayed with:


.. code-block:: none

   ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet addr'
         inet addr:10.20.1.227  Bcast:10.20.1.255  Mask:255.255.254.0


The current Out-of-Band network configuration settings are displayed
with:


.. code-block:: none

   ipmitool -H 127.0.0.1 -U admin -P admin lan print


The Out-of-Band management system can be set to obtain an IP address
from DHCP with:


.. code-block:: none

   ipmitool -H 127.0.0.1 -U admin -P admin lan set 1 ipsrc dhcp


The Out-of-Band management system can be set to use a static IP
address and netmask. This example shows setting the IP address to
*192.168.100.100* with a netmask of *255.255.255.0*:


.. code-block:: none

   ipmitool -H 127.0.0.1 -U admin -P admin lan set 1 ipsrc static
   ipmitool -H 127.0.0.1 -U admin -P admin lan set 1 ipaddr 192.168.100.10
   ipmitool -H 127.0.0.1 -U admin -P admin lan set 1 netmask 255.255.255.0


Log out of the Out-of-Band management system by typing :literal:`exit`
and pressing :kbd:`Enter`.

After use, disconnect the black USB to serial cable from the X10.
**Do not leave it connected to the X10.**

Connect to the X10 Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


With IPMI
^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: An IPMI remote management utility must be installed on the
   laptop or desktop computer used to manage the X10 remotely, and the
   computer must have access to the same network as the %brand% X10.
   For FreeBSD, macOS, or Linux,
   `IPMItool <https://sourceforge.net/projects/ipmitool/>`__
   can be used. For Windows,
   `ipmiutil <http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/>`__
   is available.


When the Out-of-Band management IP address has been determined, the
X10 console is accessible through IPMI. In this example,
*192.168.100.100* is the IP address assigned to the Out-of-Band
management interface.


For computers using :command:`ipmitool` on FreeBSD, macOS, or Linux,
enter:


.. code-block:: none

   ipmitool -I lanplus -H 192.168.100.100 -U admin -a sol activate


For Windows computers with :command:`ipmiutil`, enter:


.. code-block:: none

   ipmiutil sol -N 192.168.100.100 -U admin -a


Enter **admin** for the password, and the X10 console is connected.


.. tip:: The Out-of-Band console password can be changed by
   temporarily connecting the black USB to 3.5mm serial cable to the
   serial port, #5 on
   :numref:`Figure %s <x10_back>`,
   as described in
   :ref:`the serial cable connection instructions <X10_Serial_Cable>`.
   Then give this command to set the new password, shown as
   *newpassword* in this example:

   .. code-block:: none

      ipmitool -H 127.0.0.1 -U admin -P admin user set password 2 newpassword


   After use, disconnect the black USB to serial cable from the X10.
   **Do not leave it connected to the X10.**


Proceed to :ref:`Using the X10 Console`.


With the Serial Cable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The X10 console can be directly connected to a serial terminal program
by temporarily disconnecting the gray serial cable from the system
console serial port, #10 on
:numref:`Figure %s <x10_back>`,
and temporarily connecting the black USB to serial cable to that port.

Connect the USB end of the black USB to serial cable to a laptop or
desktop computer running serial terminal software. See
:ref:`X10_Out-of-Band Serial Terminal Communication Settings` for the
serial device name. Set the terminal software to:

.. code-block:: none

   115200 baud
   8 data bits
   no stop bits
   no parity
   no flow control


Wait two minutes after the X10 has been connected to power, then press
:kbd:`Enter` to display the console menu. Find the
:literal:`The web user interface is at:` message and write down the IP
address. After viewing the X10 console, disconnect the black USB to
serial cable and reconnect the gray System Management cable to the
system serial console port, #10 on
:numref:`Figure %s <x10_back>`.
**Do not leave the black USB to serial cable connected to the X10.**


.. _Using the X10 Console:

Using the X10 Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The X10 console has two modes: SES (SCSI Enclosure Services) mode, and
the standard X86 console mode.

If :literal:`ESM A =>` is displayed, the X10 is in SES mode.
Switch to the X86 console mode by typing these characters:

.. code-block:: none

   $%^0


The normal X86 console is displayed.


.. note:: The SES console can be displayed again by typing these
   characters:

   .. code-block:: none

      $%^2


Perform %brand% Initial Software Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
