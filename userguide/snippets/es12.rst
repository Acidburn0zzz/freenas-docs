~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ES12 has front panel indicators for power, unit identify and
fault. The Fault indicator is on during the initial power-on self-test
(POST) or when the %brand% software has issued an
`alert
<https://support.ixsystems.com/truenasguide/tn_options.html#alert>`__.

Rail Kit Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Mount the Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open the clamp latches on the ends of each rail. Place the rail in
the rack with the front end toward the front of the rack, aligning
the pins on both ends of the rail with the mounting holes in the rack.
Swing the clamp latch closed to hold the rail in place. Use two of the
supplied screws to secure the back end of the rail in place. Repeat
the process for the second rail.

   Rail Clamp Latch


Mount the Unit in the Rack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Caution: Two people are required to safely lift the chassis for rack
installation or removal.** Do not install drives until after the
chassis has been installed in the rack, and remove all drives before
removing the chassis from the rack.

Snap the black bezel mounting ears onto the metal X10 chassis ears.
Carefully place the X10 chassis onto the rails mounted in the rack.
Push the X10 chassis in until the ears are flush with the front of the
rack.  Use two of the supplied screws to secure each ear to the rack.


Install Drive Trays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array. Each drive tray has
a status LED which is blue when active or amber if a fault has
occurred.

Press the blue button to open the latch. Carefully slide the tray into
a drive bay until the left side of the latch touches the metal front
edge of the chassis, then gently swing the latch closed until it
clicks into place.

Connect Expansion Shelves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect Power Cords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXME

If any %brand% expansion shelves are connected to the X10 array, power
them on first, then wait at least two minutes before connecting power
cables to the X10 array.  **Do not plug the power cords into a power
outlet yet.** Connect a power cord to the back of one power supply,
pressing it into the plastic clamp and pressing on the tab to lock it
in place. Repeat the process for the second power supply and cord.

   Power Cord Connection


FIXME

After both power cords have been connected to the X10, they can be
plugged into power outlets. The X10 is configured to automatically
power on when connected to a power outlet. This design ensures that
the X10 comes back on when power is restored after a power failure.


Install Bezel (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included bezel is not required for operation. If desired, install
the bezel by aligning it with the pins on the bezel ears and pressing
it into place.


Perform %brand% Initial Software Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The console displays the IP address of the %brand% X10 graphical web
interface, *192.168.100.231* in this example:
