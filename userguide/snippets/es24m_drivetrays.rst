Install Drive Trays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array. Each drive bay in
the chassis has two indicator LEDs to the right of the tray. The
status LED is blue when the drive is active, and the fault LED is
amber if a fault has occurred.

Press the silver button to open the drive tray latch. Carefully slide
the tray into a drive bay until the right side of the latch touches
the metal front edge of the chassis, then gently swing the latch
closed until it clicks into place.
