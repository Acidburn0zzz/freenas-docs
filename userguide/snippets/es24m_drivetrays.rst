Install Drive Trays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array. Each drive tray has
a status LED which is blue when active or amber if a fault has
occurred.

Press the silver button to open the latch. Carefully slide the tray
into a drive bay until the right side of the latch touches the metal
front edge of the chassis, then gently swing the latch closed until it
clicks into place.
