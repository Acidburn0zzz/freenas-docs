Contributing to %brand%

Translation
-----------

Not everyone speaks English, and having a complete translation of the
user interface into native languages can make %brand% much more useful
to communities around the world.

%brand% uses
`Weblate <https://weblate.org/en/>`__
to manage the translation of text shown in the %brand% graphical
administrative interface. Weblate provides an easy-to-use web-based
editor and commenting system, making it possible for individuals to
assist with translation or comment on existing translations.

To see the status of translations, open
`<https://weblate.trueos.org/projects/freenas/>`__, as shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <contribute_weblate_fig>`.
