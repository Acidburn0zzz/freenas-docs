==============

`vCenter Server <https://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-server.html>`__
is server management software that uses a single console to manage a
virtual infrastructure across a hybrid cloud of physical and virtual
machines. The %brand% vCenter plugin integrates the control and
operation of %brand% into VMware vCenter Server.

**Features:**

* Unify %brand% and other network resources in the vCenter Server
  platform.

* Use vCenter to manage %brand%: datastore creation and sharing,
  storage snapshot backups, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

* Simple installation process with a single tool to install and manage
  the plugin.

The %brand% vCenter plugin is available separately from %brand%. To
