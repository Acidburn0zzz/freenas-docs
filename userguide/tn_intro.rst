configuration workflow, this document can be used as a reference guide
to the many features provided by %brand%.

**Typographic Conventions**

The %brand% Administrator Guide uses the following typographic
conventions:

* Names of graphical elements such as buttons, icons, fields, columns,
  and boxes are enclosed within quotes. For example: click the
  :guilabel:`Import Ca` button.

* Menu selections are italicized and separated by arrows. For example:
  :menuselection:`System --> Information`.

* Commands that are mentioned within text are highlighted in
  :command:`bold text`. Command examples and command output are
  contained in green code blocks.

* Volume, dataset, and file names are enclosed in a blue box
  :file:`/like/this`.

* Keystrokes are formatted in a blue box. For example: press
  :kbd:`Enter`.

* **bold text:** used to emphasize an important point.

  into a GUI field.
