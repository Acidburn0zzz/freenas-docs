Task Manager
============

The task manager shows a list of tasks performed by the %brand% system
starting with the most recent. Click a task name to show start time, progress, finish time, and whether
the task succeeded are displayed. If a task failed, the
error status is shown.

Some tasks have a log. If a task run has a long, select that task and
and click :guilabel:`View Logs`.

The task manager can be opened by clicking |ui-task-manager|. Close the
task manager by clicking :guilabel:`CLOSE`, clicking anywhere outside
the task manager dialog, or by pressing :kbd:`Esc`.
