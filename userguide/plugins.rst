.. warning:: The plugins infrastructure now uses the iocage backend.
   The warden backend has been removed and is no longer supported.
   Plugin magement has been removed entirely from the legacy UI.
   It is recommended to recreate all legacy plugin jails using the
   new UI, copy over any existing configurations, and delete the
   old plugin jail datasets after the new plugin jails are working as
   expected.

To download a plugin, follow the instructions in the Plugins chapter of
the `guide <%docurl%/freenas>`__.
