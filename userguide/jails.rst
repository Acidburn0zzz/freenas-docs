Jails
=====

.. warning:: The jails infrastructure now uses the iocage backend.
   The warden backend has been removed and is no longer supported.
   Jail magement has been removed entirely from the legacy UI.
   It is recommended to recreate all legacy jails using the new UI,
   copy over any existing configurations, and delete the old jail
   datasets after the new jails are working as expected.

To create a jail, follow the instructions in the Jails chapter of
the `guide <%docurl%/freenas>`__.
