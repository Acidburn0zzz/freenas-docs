Hardware Setup
==============

%brand% hardware consists of one or two main *Unified Storage Array*
units.  Optional *Expansion Shelves* can be added to expand storage
capacity. Racking and connection of these units is described
individually below.

.. note:: Always perform the initial %brand% setup in consultation
   with an iXsystems Support Representative. iXsystems Support can
   be contacted at :literal:`support@iXsystems.com` or 1-855-GREP4-iX
   (1-855-473-7449) or 1-408-943-4100.

   Please locate the hardware serial numbers for easy reference. These
   numbers are on the back of each chassis.
