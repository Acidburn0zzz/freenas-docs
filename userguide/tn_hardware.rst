.. _Hardware Setup:

Hardware Setup
==============

%brand% hardware consists of one or two main *Unified Storage Array*
units.  Optional *Expansion Shelves* can be added to expand storage
capacity. Racking and connection of these units is described
individually below.

If the %brand% Storage Array does not arrive in perfect condition, or
if any parts are missing, please take photos and contact iXsystems
support immediately.

.. note:: Always perform the initial %brand% setup in consultation
   with an iXsystems Support Representative. iXsystems Support can
   be contacted at :literal:`truenas-support@ixsystems.com`. Have all
   %brand% hardware serial numbers available. These are located on the
   back of each chassis.
